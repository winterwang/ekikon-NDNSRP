# Outline of today's talk 

--
### Correspondence analyses:


- Relationship between **food consumed** and **eating location** for UK adolescents


- Relationship between **food consumed** and **eating time** for UK adults according to their diabetes status 

--

### Multilevel Latent Class Analysis:

- Relationship between **carbohydrate consumption** and **eating time** for UK adults.

class: middle

## Some intuition about correspondence analysis  (CA)

- CA is a method for investigating the relationship in a **two-dimensional contingency table**.

- It takes a large table, and turns it into a seemingly easy-to-read visualization.

## Analysis of a contingency table

- The frequency of consumption of three healthy food groups at each location in the NDNS RP data among teenagers (age: 11~19 years):

```{r eval = T, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
load("../CA-NDNSRP/H_teenFood.Rdata")

TableFoogGroup <- H_teenFood %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(mfgLab) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), meanHpoint = mean(H_points, na.rm = T), mfgCalories = sum(Energykcal)) %>% 
  arrange(-mfgCalories) %>% 
  mutate(n.freq = paste0(round(100 * n/sum(n), 2), "%"))  %>% 
  mutate(cal.Prop = paste0(round(100 * mfgCalories/sum(mfgCalories), 2), "%"))  %>% 
  mutate(calprop = mfgCalories/sum(mfgCalories)) %>% 
  mutate(calcumprop = paste0(round(100 * cumsum(calprop), 3), "%")) %>% 
  select(-calprop) 


TableFoogGroup <- TableFoogGroup %>% 
  mutate(healthy     = meanHpoint < -2, 
         lesshealthy = meanHpoint > 4, 
         neutral     = (meanHpoint <= 4) & (meanHpoint >= -2))

# TableFoogGroup %>% 
#   filter(healthy) %>% 
#   select(-lesshealthy, -neutral, -calcumprop, -healthy)
healthyfg <- H_teenFood %>% 
  filter(mfgLab %in% c("Fruit", "Veg not raw", "Brown Bread"))
freqtab <- xtabs(~healthyfg$mfgLab + healthyfg$Locat_type)
freqtabmg <- addmargins(freqtab)
as.data.frame.matrix(freqtabmg) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) 
```


---
class: middle 

## Usually, we will conduct a $\chi^2$ test. 

```{r eval = T, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
as.data.frame.matrix(freqtabmg) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) 
```


$$
\chi^2 = \sum\frac{(\text{Observed} - \text{Expected})^2}{\text{Expected}} \sim \chi^2_{(m -1)\times(n-1)}
$$

--
To look for evidence against the null hypothesis that **there is no difference across the columns or rows**.

---
class: middle
## Hypothesis of independence

The null hypothesis of no difference across the columns or rows is also called: **Hypothesis of independence, or Homogeneity assumption.**

```{r}
chisq.test(freqtab)
```


We conclude that **there is dependency between the columns (food groups) and the rows (locations)**. 

---
class: middle

## But what exactly does this dependency mean?


```{r eval = T, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
as.data.frame.matrix(freqtabmg) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))%>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) 
```

### Can we get **more information** from this contingency table? How?

--
### Yes! we can visualize their relationships!


---
class: middle 

### Step 1 - convert the frequency cell to proportions

```{r echo = FALSE}
Xp <- as.matrix(freqtab) / sum(as.matrix(freqtab))
Xpmg <- addmargins(Xp)
Xpmg <- signif(Xpmg, digits = 3)

Xp_4 <- sprintf("%.4f", Xpmg)
Xp_4 <- matrix(Xp_4, nrow = 4)
row.names(Xp_4) <- c("Brown Bread", "Fruit", "Veg not raw", "c: col masses")
colnames(Xp_4) <- c("Others", "Home", "School_work", "r: row masses")

as.data.frame.matrix(Xp_4) %>%
  kable(caption = "Matrix X. Observed Cell Proportions") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) 
```

???
- Row masses: $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{X1}$ 

```{r}
r <- Xp %*% matrix(c(1, 1, 1), nrow = 3)
```

- Column masses: $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{1}$

```{r}
c <- t(Xp)  %*% matrix(c(1, 1, 1), nrow = 3)
```


- On average (77.8%) most of the healthy foods are eaten at home

---
class: middle 
### Step 2 - The deviation (residuals) of each cell in matrix X from its expected value

$$\text{Deviation} = \mathbf{X} - \mathbf{rc}^T$$

```{r echo=FALSE}
Deviation <- Xp - r %*% t(c)
library(formattable)
Deviation <- addmargins(Deviation)
Dev <- sprintf("%.5f", Deviation)
Dev <- matrix(Dev, nrow = 4)
rownames(Dev) <- rownames(Deviation)
colnames(Dev) <- colnames(Deviation)
as.data.frame.matrix(Dev) %>%
  kable(caption = "Deviations from Expected") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) 
```

???
Big positive (negative) numbers means a strong positive (negative) relationship.


The residuals quantify the difference between the observed data and the data we would expect under the assumption that there is no relationship between the row and column categories of the table.

---
class: middle

### Step 3 - Standardise the residual for fair comparison (Z score)

$$
\mathbf{Z}  = \mathbf{D}_r^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times \text{Deviation} \times \mathbf{D}_c^{-\frac{1}{2}}
$$



```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
Deviation <- Xp - r %*% t(c)
Dr <- diag(as.numeric(r))
Dc <- diag(as.numeric(c))
z <- solve(expm::sqrtm((Dr))) %*% Deviation %*% solve(expm::sqrtm((Dc)))

Z_name <- sprintf("%.5f", z)
Z_name <- matrix(Z_name, nrow = 3)
rownames(Z_name) <- c("Brown Bread", "Fruit", "Veg not raw")
colnames(Z_name) <- c("Others", "Home", "School_work")
as.data.frame.matrix(Z_name) %>%
  kable(caption = "Standardised Residuals Table") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T) 
```


???
These standardized residuals are z-scores.  This means that values of more than 1.96, or less than -1.96, are significant at the 0.05 level. For binary variables, their standard deviation is the square root of their expected values. 


---
class: middle

### Step 4 - Single Value Decomposition

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{UD}_\lambda \mathbf{V}^T
$$

Where, 

- $\mathbf{Z}$: the standardised deviation matrix; 
- $\mathbf{U}$: the left singular vectors of $\mathbf{Z}$ <br> (principal axes of food groups space **for projection of locations**); 
- $\mathbf{D}_\lambda$: singular values matrix;
- $\mathbf{V}^T$: right singular vectors of $\mathbf{Z}$<br> (principal axes of location space **for projection of food groups**).

---
class: middle

### Recall that in principle component analysis (PCA)  - Spectral decomposition

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{P}\Lambda\mathbf{P}^T
$$

### It is also easy to prove that 

$$
\mathbf{D}_\lambda^2 = \Lambda
$$

???

- S is the variance covariance matrhx 
- Lambda is the diagonal eigenvalue matrix 
- P is orthogonal projection matrix with new coordinates for the rotated new variables

---
class: middle
### Step 4 - Single Value Decomposition

.small[
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{Z}  & = \mathbf{UD}_\lambda \mathbf{V}^T \\ 
\mathbf{Z}  & = \left[\begin{matrix}
0.00039&-0.032&0.083\\
0.02285&-0.071&0.162\\
-0.01694&0.064&-0.148
\end{matrix}\right] \\
= \left[\begin{matrix}
-0.34&0.8980&0.28\\

\end{matrix}\right]& 
\left(\begin{matrix}

0.39&0.26&0.88\\
-0.91&0.22&0.34
\end{matrix}\right]\\
\end{aligned}
$$
]

In R, simply do 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
svd(z)
```

### Step 5 - Calculate row profile, and column profile, centre them

.pull-left[

.small[
- Percentages of location for each food was eaten:

```{r echo=FALSE}

Rmg <- addmargins(R)[-4,]

rownames(Rmg) <- NULL

Rmg_4 <- sprintf("%.4f", Rmg)
Rmg_4 <- matrix(Rmg_4, nrow = 3)
rownames(Rmg_4) <- rownames(Rmg)
colnames(Rmg_4) <- colnames(Rmg)

as.data.frame.matrix(Rmg_4) %>%
  kable(caption = "Matrix R. Row Profile") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{R} & = \mathbf{D}^{-1}_r\mathbf{X} \\
\mathbf{R} &\; - \mathbf{1c}^T
\end{aligned}
$$
]]

.pull-right[
.small[
- Percentages of food was eaten at each location:

```{r echo = FALSE}
C <- solve(Dc) %*% t(Xp)

Cmg <- addmargins(t(C))[,-4]
Cmg <- signif(Cmg, digits = 3)
colnames(Cmg) <- c("Others", "Home", "School")



Cmg_4 <- sprintf("%.4f", Cmg)
Cmg_4 <- matrix(Cmg_4, nrow = 4)
rownames(Cmg_4) <- rownames(Cmg)
colnames(Cmg_4) <- colnames(Cmg)


as.data.frame.matrix(Cmg_4) %>%
  kable(caption = "Matrix C. Column Profile") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = T)

$$
\begin{aligned}

### Step 6 - Find principal coordinates for rows and columns

.pull-left[
.small[- Project the centred row profiles (food groups) onto to principal axes of locations $\mathbf{V}$
$$ 
F = (\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{1c}^T)(\mathbf{D}_c^{-1})(\mathbf{D}_c^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{V})
$$

```{r echo = FALSE}

V <- svd(z)$v

CentR <- R - matrix(c(1, 1, 1), nrow = 3) %*% t(c)

## sqare root of matrix Dc
a.eig <- eigen(Dc)
Dc.sqrt <- a.eig$vectors %*% diag(sqrt(a.eig$values)) %*% solve(a.eig$vectors)

]]

.pull-right[
.small[
- Project the centred column prifiles (locations) onto principal axes of food groups $\mathbf{U}$

$$ 
G = (\mathbf{C} - \mathbf{1r}^T)(\mathbf{D}_r^{-1})(\mathbf{D}_r^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{U})
$$

```{r echo = FALSE}
U <- svd(z)$u

G_4 <- sprintf("%.4f", G)
G_4 <- matrix(G_4, nrow = 3)
G_4 <- G_4[, -3]
rownames(G_4) <-  c("Others", "Home", "School_work")
colnames(G_4) <- c("Horizontal", "Vertical")
 

as.data.frame.matrix(G_4) %>%

- the vertical axis may be interpreted as moving from structured environments (home, school-work) to unstructured (Other - leisure, party, mobile, bus, etc.)

- The percentage label for each axis is a measure of how much of the total variation in the data (inertia) has been captured in that axis. 

- So 99.8% of total variation of the contingency table is explained by the horizontal axis.

## The healthiness of food groups

- Healthiness scoring system is based on a system from Rayner et al. 2013.

- Categorisation of this point is controversial, roughly, the lower the point, the healthier it is considered.

- Later we use tertiles to separate the foods into three groups.

## Correlation between chocolate and meat pastries

- The correlation between two profile vectors, $\mathbf{f1, f2}$

- can be proved to be equivalent to the cosine of the angle between the vectors: $$\cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf{f1  f2}}{|f1||f2|}$$

- We applied bootstrapping approach (10000 subsamples with replacement) and run CA on each sample, and calculate $\cos\theta$ for each sample

# Conclusion

- Sweetened soft drinks, chips, and chocolates are more likely to be consumed when a teenager finds himself/herself at locations other than Home or School.

- Meat pastries are more likely to be consumed outside of Home (because school and other locations are equally likely)

- Odds of eating fruit at other locations are significantly lower than at home, and at school.

class: middle

## Correlation between chocolate and meat pastries

- Chocolate and meat pastries have location profiles which are strongly correlated.

- Both conveient foods to carry and eat.

- Both available at low prices (<£2).

---
class: middle

## Why These are important?

- Large proportion of food consumed at other locations is packaged and sold, rather than cooked meals at home or school. 

- Policymakers may need to legislate and regulate about what is sold, how the price should be, how they should be packaged and promoted for teenagers.

## Objectives

- To investigate and describe the relationshipt between **food** eaten by British adults, **time slots** and **diabetes status**.

## Methods and strategies

- Correspodence analysis (CA)
    - Biplots stratified by diabetes status

- Mixed effect logistic regression using generalized estimating equation (GEE). 

- Generate hypotheses from half of the food recordings, and test using the other half.

- Time slots defined:  6-9 am, 9-12 noon, 12-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, 8-10 pm and 10 pm-6 am.

- It seems that later time in the day (8 pm- 10pm-) are shown on the upper side of the plot. 

- Morning time people are having breakfast foods (cereals/milk)

- Chocolate, Bear, Spirits, sugar candy, sweetened soft drinks are clouded around later times.

# Discussion 

- Assessing the relationships between less healthy foods and timing of eating is a first step towards identifying specific public health targets for behaviour change/modification.

- Potentially alcoholic/sweetened beverages and foods rich in added sugars and saturated fats. 

<!-- - The greater odds of eating puddings in the evening might partly explain the undiagnosed/prediabetic state.  -->

- The survey cross-sectional nature warrants further investigations by longitudinal cohort studies.
